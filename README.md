## Contributing

If you would like to help me write better algorithms feel free to download the contents of this repository and add to the tests I have written to add corner cases that I may not have thought of. If you find a fault in my algorithm or see I missed a corner case in my tests feel free to create an issue with the error and the expected behavior and why. I will update my code and run your tests. Anyone who helps will be added to the CONTRIBUTORS.md file.
